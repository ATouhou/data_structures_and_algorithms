# Color & Bitwise Binary Operators

## What is a Bit

A bit is a basic unit of information. AKA a binary digit. 

It can only have one of two values. These values are most commonly represented as a 1 or a 0.

Remember taking those punch cards style tests when you were little? Where you circled in the little dots? That was where the concept of a bit came in. Paper could be fed into a computer, and depending on whether holes were punched in or not was the data was passed around.

## What is Decimal

Our integer numbering system is base 10. Meaning, we use 10 different symbols to represent numbers.

| Decimal     |
|-------------|
| 0           |
| 1           |
| 2           |
| 3           |
| 4           |
| 5           |
| 6           |
| 7           |
| 8           |
| 9           |

So in order to get a decimal number from, say, a string - we would use the following code.

```javascript
var num = '7';
parseInt(num, 10);
```

[parseInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt) is a function we're going to hear about a lot in this lesson.

It acceptes two parameters:
- string
  - The value to parse. If it's not a string, the function converts it to one using `toString`.
- radix
  - And integer between 2 and 36 that is the base in the mathematical numeral system. 

If you recall, we want to convert this string to a decimal integer - so we pass `10` in as our radix. 

`parseInt` will usually default to base ten if no radix is specified, but it is best practice to **always specify this parameter** to avoid confusion and guarantee predicatable behavior.

## What is Binary

Computers count using binary, which is a number system made up of zeros and ones (bits). 

So if we wanted to convert a Number to binary, we could do so in the following way.

```javascript
var num = 10;
num.toString(2);
```

[toString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString) is a function we will also be using often in this lesson.

Here you are calling the Number prototype toString method and passing it a radix of 2. 

Note: If you don't specify a radix, toString will default to base 10 (decimal)

Putting things all together, if you wanted to write a decimal to binary converter that could handle string AND integer input - you might write something like:

```javascript
  parseInt(n, 10).toString(2);
  // if string, convert to base ten number type
  // if already number type, convert to string and convert back to Number
  // call Number's prototype function toString() and tell it base 2
```

Note: What if the decimal is a negative number? Try reading through the top answer on this [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9939760/how-do-i-convert-an-integer-to-binary-in-javascript) and using the `>>>` (right logical shift)

## What is Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is base 16, meaning it uses sixteen characters to display numbers.

| Decimal | Hexadecimal |
|---------|-------------|
| 0 - 10  | 0 - 9       |
| 10 - 15 | A - F       |
| 16 - 25 | 10 - 19     |
| 26      | 1A          |
| 27      | 1B          |
| ... etc | ... etc     |

So if we wanted to convert a decimal to hex

```javascript
  var num = 11;
  num.toString(16); // "b"
  
  var num = '11';
  parseInt(num, 10).toString(16)
```

If you want to see the entire graph, try running the following code in a console

```javascript
  for(var i = 0; i < 100; i++){
    console.log(i, ' - ', i.toString(16));
  }
```
Hexadecimal was widely adopted because it is so easy to convert from hexadecimal to binary (the language of computers). Basically, hexadecimal is used to display binary in a shorter string.

Binary is base 2, hexadecimal is base 16.

2 to the power of 4 is 16

So you need a 4 digit binary to map to a one digit hexadecimal symbol.

| Hexadecimal | Binary |
|-------------|--------|
| 0           | 0000   |
| 1           | 0001   |
| 2           | 0010   |
| 3           | 0011   |
| 4           | 0100   |
| 5           | 0101   |
| 6           | 0110   |
| 7           | 0111   |
| 8           | 1000   |
| 9           | 1001   |
| A           | 1010   |
| B           | 1011   |
| C           | 1100   |
| D           | 1101   |
| E           | 1110   |
| F           | 1111   |

## What is RGB

Color or a TV or computer screen is controlled by adjusting three settings: Red, Green and Blue.

Each color value can range between 0 to 255

If all colors are set to zero (0, 0, 0) - the absense of light sets the screen to black.

If all three colors are set as high as possible (255, 255, 255) - the screen will be white.

The reason for 0 to 255 is because 8 digits in a binary system is the same as 255.

RGB values are encoded as 8-bit integers.

1111 1111 in binary equals 255.

- Blue: Bits from 0-7
- Green: Bits from 8-15 
- Red: Bits from 16-23

## What is a Bitwise Operation

A bitwise operation proccesses bits one at a time. In other languages, they can be refered to as bit `shifters` which might make what they do a little clearer.

There is an [MDN article on how to use bitwise operators in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators).

> Bitwise operators treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits (zeroes and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.

Which basically means, these operators convert numbers to their bits and work with them at the bit level.

#### An Example

Integers are stored, in memory, as a series of bits. For example, the number 6 when stored as a 32-bit `int` is:

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000110
```

So if you shifted the bit patter to the left one position with a left shift operator `(6 << 1)`, it would be

```
00000000 00000000 00000000 00001100
```

Which equals `12` in decimal.

Take a second to scroll up and look at the hexadecimal to binary table above and compare the 2 outcomes.

0110 is 6 (in both hexadecimal and decimal symbols)

1100 is 'c' in hexadecimal

If you then convert hexadecimal to decimal `parseInt('c', 16)`

You get 12.

#### An Example with Color

Bitwise operators are not something we use every day in JavaScript - but in the case of converting rgb to hex codes, it's super effective.

```javascript
var hex = 'FFEBCD'; //blanchedalmond
var rgb = parseInt(hex, 16); // 16772045
// if we convert to a series of bits rgb = "111111111110101111001101"

// 0xFF is the same as 11111111
var r = (rgb >> 16) & 0xFF; // 255
var g = (rgb >> 8) & 0xFF; // 235
var b = rgb & 0xFF; // 205
```

`(rbg >> 16)` = 255

What happens is we right shift by 16 bits

so 

rbg is "111111111110101111001101"

The r value is "11111111"

`(rgb >> 8)` = 235

So we shift right 8 bits

The g value is "11101011"

But then for blue, we do something interesting and take the entire bit sequence "111111111110101111001101"

How does this work?

Now it's time to explain the `Bitwise AND` or `&`

```
a & b 
```

The Bitwise AND operator (`&`) returns a one in each position for the which the corresponding bits are both operands and ones.

So if `0xFF` is the same as `11111111`...

then when we call `111111111110101111001101` & `11111111`

We get `11001101`

In other words, we get the last 8 bits.

Mind blown? That's okay. Play around with it a little bit and [read through the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators).
