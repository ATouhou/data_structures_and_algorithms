## Data Structures & Algorithms

In the process of becoming or practicing as a web application developer, it's easy to lose sight of Computer Science.

This collection of exercises and experiments seeks to help you build an understanding of those foundations.

* binary trees - README|Ruby|JavaScript
* Pathfinding Algorithm with A* - README|Ruby?
* luhn algorithm (checksumming) - README|Ruby
* graphs - README
* linked lists - README|Ruby|JavaScript
* bloom filters - README
* Hash Array Mapped Trie - README
* Hash Maps - README
